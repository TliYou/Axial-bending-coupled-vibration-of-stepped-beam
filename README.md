# Axial-bending-coupled-vibration-of-stepped-beam
Use an analytical method to solve both the free and forced vibration of axially loaded stepped laminated beams with general layers and arbitrary boundary conditions.  
This project provides code for the numerical examples shown in Ref. [1]. Readers may refer to the article if they would like to dig deeper into the algorithm.
